# Introduction #

This is a 'what if' suggestion, and it assumes that a user will be able to choose their party make-up.

Having 2 or more of 1 class in your party would add 'synergies'.
Having a full party of 1 class would add an additional level of 'synergy'.

Synergies are intended to make experimenting with different parties fun and effective.  Of course to gain a synergy the player must sacrifice flexibility.  The chance of success can be used to balance synergies, so they don't become overpowered.

Synergies would always be active (even 4 person synergies) so long as 2 or more of the class is 'healthy'.  Maybe injured units should count toward synergies.   (Incapacitated units do not count for synergies.)

Synergies stack.

Some examples broken down by class
  * Mage: 2 mages would have the capacity to SILENCE casters (a chance on an enemies turn to  have 1 enemy unit's heal or fire ball attack disabled for that turn).  4 mage party RAIN OF FIRE (chance for an additional fire ball attack to be cast against an enemy).
  * Rogue: 2 rogues would make a SINISTER PACT (a chance when a party member is attacked for one of the rogues to counter attack the attacker --  this does not interrupt the original attack).  4 rogues are a GUILD OF THIEVES (a chance to give the rogue party an extra turn like the proposed 'trap' skill, and would stack with a trap unfolding a 'master plan' granting 2 additional turns).
  * Warrior: 2 warriors would be able to coordinate their defense in a PHALANX (the phalanx gives a chance for a warrior to take an attack rather than 1 of their allies -- an injured warrior never participates in the phalanx if a healthy warrior is available).  4 warriors would be able to route the enemy into a FORCED RETREAT (a chance for an enemy unit to be forced to run away).
  * Priest: 2 priests would enable each other to RESURRECT HEAL (a chance when healing an incapacitated ally to heal them fully to healthy status).  4 priests would receive DIVINE PROTECTION (a chance for an extra heal to be cast at the start of the party's turn).
