This wiki is for the development of the graphical, turn-based computer game based on the mini mam role-playing. To discuss or contribute to the mini mam role-playing game rules themselves, please visit http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Mini_mam. The mini mam role-playing game rules, are loosely based on the Mano a Mano Role-Playing System which has much more detail: http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Mano_a_Mano.

= Exploring =

The player controls a group of characters who explore a randomly generated map. This could be a cave, tomb, dungeon, castle, town, wilderness, country or world map. The characters all stay together and move from one discrete location to a connected location each turn. Characters may detect monsters or traps blocking passage (to/through?) other locations. The player can then decide whether the characters should avoid that route. The characters can be caught by an undetected trap and forced to fight at a disadvantage.

= Fighting =

The player's characters (PCs) and their enemies are shown standing close together in a rough circle, with the PCs on the left and the enemies on the right. On each PC's turn, the player can select an enemy to attack or a character to heal, or the player can command the PC to try to escape. Until the chooses what the PC will do, the PC moves to the center of the circle. After attacking an enemy a character returns to his original position in the circle.
